### Section OVH
OVH API credentials. Get yours at this URL https://www.ovh.com/auth/api/createToken?GET=/me

### Section General
You can learn how to create your own here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks.

### Embeds
In the config sample, you will find how they are supposed to look. It is an Array/List of Discord embed objects (More here: https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/embeds.html#using-an-embed-object).
The embed position matters. Position [0] is when an attack has been detected. Position [1] is when an attack ended. Position [2] is for the ExternalPost endpoint. When a request to that endpoint has been successful, the embed at this position will get sent.

#### Embeds - Date/Time
When customizing your embed, keep in mind that the first field in the embed is reserved for the Discord Timestamp and will get overwritten if anything else is there. Feel free to customize any other field.
```          "fields": [
            {
                "name": "Date",
                "value": ""
            }
```

### ExternalEndpoint
This is a functionality that will send a Webhook notification if enabled. If so, the http://<IP>:${externalPost.port}/external will get active. If a POST request to this URL is sent with the correct authorization header, a notification will get sent.
